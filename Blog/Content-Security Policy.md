Lately, I've been on a quest to elevate my Front-End Security skills, and one fascinating aspect I've delved into is Content-Security Policy (CSP). It's like the low-hanging fruit of security that every developer can pluck to fortify their web applications.

In a nutshell, CSP is your website's shield, and it's composed of directives that tell the browser what's safe to execute. These directives encompass a broad spectrum, from scripts and styles to form actions and more. You can explore all these directives and learn the nitty-gritty details over on the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy).

Now, the million-dollar question: How can you implement a CSP policy on your website? It's actually quite straightforward. You have two primary options – you can either integrate it into your server's response headers or embed it within a `<meta>` tag right in your HTML document.

## Example
In the next sample we disable default source in order to avoid browser fallback loading using 'default-src' locations. In addition, we allow inline `<script>` and `<style>` tags because without SSR we would need to add hashes for maximum security. As well as, we allow `data:` as image source as defined in [CSP source vales on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/Sources).

```http
Content-Security-Policy
	default-src 'none';
	script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
	style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
	img-src 'self' data:;
	object-src 'none';
	base-uri 'self';
	form-action 'self';
	font-src 'self';
	connect-src 'self';
	frame-src 'self';
	frame-ancestors 'self'
```

But wait, there's more! To make your journey into Front-End Security even more exciting, there's a handy tool you can use to test your application against well-known attack vectors – it's called [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/). Fire it up, let it loose on your application, and watch as it fearlessly explores each public endpoint, providing you with valuable recommendations.

## Conclusion
Taking these steps can be a game-changer in the security of your web applications. So, dive into CSP, harness the power of OWASP ZAP, and take your Front-End Security to the next level!
