I recently discovered a new toy called scroll-driven animations. Since itâ€™s a fresh feature currently only available in Chrome, I thought it would be the perfect time to dive into something new in modern CSS. Iâ€™d heard about it several times in [newsletters](https://codepen.io/spark) and [podcasts](https://thecsspodcast.libsyn.com/090-scroll-driven-animations), but until now, I didnâ€™t find it particularly appealing. Turns out, I was so wrongâ€¦ so letâ€™s dive in!

## Rules

Scroll-driven animations, like regular CSS animations, enable you to play animationsâ€”but only when certain scroll conditions are met. Unlike regular animations, which start immediately as soon as the CSS rule is applied, scroll-driven animations use a different trigger mechanism.

In my opinion, `animation-timeline` is the key to understanding how it works. This CSS property lets you control the animationâ€™s progress. You can link the animation to the visibility of the current element using `view()` or to a completely different element in the DOM with `--timeline-name`.

```css
.item {
  /* ...*/
  animation-timeline: view(); /* Set the timeline to the element's closest scrollbar axis along its visible! */
  /* animation-timeline: scroll();  if we want to track the whole scroll area */
}
```

Another very useful property is `animation-range`, which specifies when the animation should start and end relative to the timeline. You can find a great debugger [here](https://scroll-driven-animations.style/tools/view-timeline/ranges/) that helps you understand timeline ranges more clearly.

```css
.item {
  /* ...*/
  animation-range: entry 5% cover 40%; /* Start when 5% of the element's scroll port is reached and stop when 40% of the element's visiblity is reached
}
```

Want to animate your target based on a different part of the DOM? No problemâ€”you can specify a custom scroll container for the animated element. For example, this allows you to create a GPU-accelerated horizontal scroll progress indicator.

```css
 html {
   scroll-timeline: --page-scroll block;
}
.progress {
   animation: grow-progress auto linear;
   animation-timeline: --page-scroll;
}
```

## Caveats

There are a few caveats when enabling scroll-driven animations. The first is browser supportâ€”at the time of writing, itâ€™s only available in Chrome. Because of this, itâ€™s strongly recommended to use progressive enhancement with the `@supports` rule.

The second is the declaration order of the `animation-timeline`.

> You need to declare `animation-timeline` after declaring any `animation` shorthand for it to take effect. Because currently the `animation` resets a previously-declared `animation-timeline`.

## Examples
Over the past few days, Iâ€™ve created several examples, which you can check out on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/collection/ZMgdmv). Alternatively, explore my site to see them in action âœ¨.

Now itâ€™s your turn to get creative ðŸ’…
